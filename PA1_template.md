## What is the average daily activity pattern?
I calculated the averaged steps across all days for each 5-minute time invertal.
Then I plot it. Using which.max () function I found that 13:55pm is the time interval 
that had the max average steps across all days.

## Imputing missing values
The mean and median from the new dataset were different from the previous dataset, because replacing the missing value with the means make the median and mean more similiar compare to the previous dataset. 


```r
sum(Activity$steps,na.rm=TRUE)
```

```
## [1] 570608

```r
Activity$steps[is.na (Activity$steps)]<-mean(Activity$steps,na.rm=TRUE)

#Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
New_Activity<-Activity

#Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Yes, there are differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends.
On weekend, the activity pattern is more homogeneous across all the time interval without an obvious peak. However, on weekdays, I observed a higher activity peak (over 200 steps) in the morning of the day, followed by an extended period of low activity.The plot pattern may suggest that people have time period limit on walking during weekday.


```r
#Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels ‚Äì ‚Äúweekday‚Äù and ‚Äúweekend‚Äù indicating whether a given date is a weekday or #weekend day.

New_Activity$weekdaydetails<-weekdays(as.Date(as.character(New_Activity$date)))
summary(New_Activity$weekdaydetails)
